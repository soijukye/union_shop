# Union Shop — Flutter Coursework

This repository contains the coursework project for students enrolled in the **Programming Applications and Programming Languages (M30235)** and **User Experience Design and Implementation (M32605)** modules at the University of Portsmouth.

## Overview

The Student Union has an e-commerce website, which you can access via this link: [https://shop.upsu.net](https://shop.upsu.net)

In short, your task is to recreate the same website using Flutter. You must not start from scratch, as this repository provides an incomplete Flutter implementation of the Student Union site that you must build upon. [The getting started section of this document](#getting-started) will explain more. Once you have completed the application, you will submit the link to your forked repository on Moodle for assessment. See the [submission section](#submission) for more details.

⚠️ The UPSU.net link on the navbar of the union website is a link to an external site. This is not part of the application that you need to develop. So ignore the link highlighted below:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You have three options for your development environment:

1. **Firebase Studio** (browser-based, no installation required)
2. **University Windows computers** (via AppsAnywhere)
3. **Personal computer** (Windows or macOS)

Below is a quick guide for each option. For more information, you can refer to [Worksheet 0 — Introduction to Dart, Git and GitHub](https://manighahrmani.github.io/sandwich_shop/worksheet-0.html) and [Worksheet 1 — Introduction to Flutter](https://manighahrmani.github.io/sandwich_shop/worksheet-1.html).

**Firebase Studio:**

- Access [idx.google.com](https://idx.google.com) with a personal Google account
- Create a new workspace (template selection not needed for this coursework)
- Clone your forked repository using the command palette

University Computers:

- Open [AppsAnywhere](https://appsanywhere.port.ac.uk/sso) and launch the following in the given order:
  - Git
  - Flutter And Dart SDK
  - Visual Studio Code

Personal Windows Computer:

- Install [Chocolatey package manager](https://chocolatey.org/install)
- Run in PowerShell (as Administrator):

  ```bash
  choco install git vscode flutter -y
  ```

Personal macOS Computer:

- Install [Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh/)
- Run in Terminal:

  ```bash
  brew install --cask visual-studio-code flutter
  ```

After installation, verify your setup by running:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

This command checks your environment and displays a report of the status of your Flutter installation.

For detailed step-by-step instructions, refer to [Worksheet 1 — Introduction to Flutter](https://manighahrmani.github.io/sandwich_shop/worksheet-1.html), which covers the complete setup process for all three options.

### Fork the Repository

Go to the repository containing the code for the coursework and click on the fork button as shown in the screenshot: [https://github.com/manighahrmani/union_shop/fork](https://github.com/manighahrmani/union_shop/fork) (Alternatively, just use this link: [https://github.com/manighahrmani/union_shop/fork](https://github.com/manighahrmani/union_shop/fork))

![Fork Button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manighahrmani/sandwich_shop/refs/heads/main/images/screenshot_fork_button.png)

Do not change anything and click on the Create fork button. You should then have a public fork of my repository with a URL like (YOUR-USERNAME replaced with your username): [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/union_shop](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/union_shop)

![Fork Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manighahrmani/sandwich_shop/refs/heads/main/images/screenshot_fork_settings.png)

Note that the name of this created fork must be “union_shop”. If you already have a repository with this name, you need to rename it beforehand.

### Clone Your Forked Repository

If you are using Firebase Studio, head to [https://idx.google.com](https://idx.google.com), click on Import Repo and paste the URL of your forked repository. Name your workspace as `union_shop`.

Otherwise, open a terminal, change to your desired directory, and run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/union_shop.git
cd union_shop
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### Install Dependencies

Your editor should automatically prompt you to install the required dependencies when you open the project. If not, open the integrated terminal (open the Command Palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` and type "Terminal: Create New Terminal") and run the following command:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Run the Application

This application is primarily designed to run on **web** and should be viewed in **mobile view** using browser developer tools. We recommend using Google Chrome.

Select Chrome as the target device and run the application either from the `main.dart` file or by entering the following command in the terminal:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

Once the app is running in Chrome, open Chrome DevTools by right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect" (or use the shortcut `F12`). Click the "Toggle device toolbar" button as shown in the screenshot below.

![Chrome DevTools Mobile View](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manighahrmani/sandwich_shop/refs/heads/main/images/screenshot_chrome_devtools.png)

From the Dimensions menu, select a mobile device preset (e.g., iPhone 12 Pro, Pixel 5):

## Marking Criteria

Your objective is to reimplement as many features from the existing [Union Shop website](https://shop.upsu.net) as you can in your forked repository using Flutter. The table below is an almost comprehensive list of features present on the website, sorted by difficulty level. Each feature has a corresponding percentage value indicating its weight and a reference link to the relevant page on the actual website.

⚠️ Note that this assessment focuses on functionality over visual design (do not spend a lot of time making it look exactly like the real website).

### Requirements

### Terminology

***Hardcoded data** refers to data that is written directly into your Flutter code. These are fixed values rather than data loaded from external sources like APIs, databases, or other services.

***Dummy data** is data that is often hardcoded or (AI) generated for display or testing purposes. It is not meant to represent real-world data stored in your services.

***Responsiveness** refers to the ability of your application to adapt its layout and design based on the screen size and orientation of the device it is being viewed on. Your app should primarily focus on mobile view but to achieve full marks in this section, it should also function correctly on wider screens (desktop view).

## Submission

You need to submit the link to your forked repository on Moodle before the deadline. Open the Moodle page for Programming Applications and Programming Languages (M30235) or User Experience Design and Implementation (M32605) and find the submission section titled "Item 1 - Set exercise (coursework) (CW)". See below:

![Moodle Submission Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manighahrmani/sandwich_shop/refs/heads/main/images/screenshot_moodle_submission_section.png)

Open the On time or the Late/Extenuating Circumstances submission link and click on Add submission. There you will find an editable Online text field. Paste the link to the GitHub repository for your coursework in the provided text field and click on Save changes. You are **not** submitting any files for this coursework.

![Moodle Submission Online Text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manighahrmani/sandwich_shop/refs/heads/main/images/screenshot_moodle_submission_online_text.png)

Make sure the repository is public. Check to see if it opens in an incognito/private window (you should not get a 404 error).

⚠️ You can edit the link before the deadline, but do not edit the repository (do not make new commits) after the deadline. I will label your submission as late if you do this.

## Project Structure

This starter repository provides a minimal skeletal structure with:

- **Homepage** (`lib/main.dart`): A basic homepage
- **Product Page** (`lib/product_page.dart`): A single product page
- **Widget Tests**: Basic tests for both of the above pages (`test/home_test.dart` and `test/product_test.dart`)

Here is an overview of the project structure:

```plaintext
union_shop/
├── lib/
│   ├── main.dart           # Main application and homepage
│   └── product_page.dart   # Product detail page
├── test/
│   ├── home_test.dart      # Homepage widget tests
│   └── product_test.dart   # Product page widget tests
├── pubspec.yaml            # Project dependencies
└── README.md               # This file
```

Note that this is the initial structure. You are of course expected to create additional files and directories as needed to complete the coursework. You can also reorganize the project structure as you see fit.

## Tips

**Commit regularly!** Save your progress frequently by committing your changes to Git. This creates checkpoints you can return to if needed.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Brief description of what you changed"
git push
```

If you made a small mistake, you can revert to a previous commit:

1. View your commit history: `git log --oneline`
2. Find the commit hash (e.g., `abc1234`) where things were working
3. Revert to that commit: `git reset --hard abc1234`
4. Force push if needed: `git push --force`

If things are completely broken and are unrecoverable, you can start fresh by re-forking the repository:

1. Delete your forked repository on GitHub (Settings → Danger Zone → Delete this repository)
2. Fork the original repository again: [https://github.com/manighahrmani/union_shop](https://github.com/manighahrmani/union_shop)
3. **Remember to keep it public!**
4. Clone your fresh fork and start again

Regular commits not only help you recover from mistakes, but also demonstrate your development process. Remember you are marked based on your commits.
